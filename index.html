    <h3>Advancing multilingual eye-tracking-while-reading research</h3>
    
    <p>
        The <a href="https://multipleye.eu/">MultiplEYE COST Action </a>invites the research community to submit abstracts to its final international conference on eye-tracking-while-reading, bringing together work from psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, NLP, and eye-tracking methodology.     
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h3>Date and venue</h3>
    
    <p>
        The conference will take place on 20-21 August 2026, in Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia, at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University – Skopje.
    </p>
    
   
    
    <h3>Purpose and scope of the conference</h3>
    
    <p>
        The conference will present the main outcomes of a <b>large-scale international collaboration</b> involving more than 350 researchers, and will serve as an <strong>open forum for the wider eye-tracking-while-reading community. We warmly welcome contributions from researchers beyond the MultiplEYE network.</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        At the conference, we will introduce <strong>a new multilingual, parallel eye-tracking-while-reading corpus,</strong> developed through a coordinated multi-lab effort. Alongside the data, we will present <strong>a fully open, FAIR-compliant pipeline</strong> covering experimental presentation, preprocessing, metadata standards, and documentation, designed to support transparency, interoperability, and reproducibility, and to enable <strong>future reuse across research communities.</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond the core data resource, the conference will <strong>disseminate key results</strong> from the MultiplEYE working groups on eye-tracking-while-reading methodology in general, psycholinguistic research using eye-tracking, and leveraging eye-tracking data for NLP.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We invite submissions on <strong>all aspects of eye-tracking-while-reading,</strong> including
    </p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 60px; padding-left: 10px;">
            <li>empirical studies</li>
            <li>computational approaches</li>
            <li>methodological contributions</li>
            <li>open science perspectives.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        The conference aims to foster cross-disciplinary exchange and to <strong>shape future directions in reading research and eye-tracking methodology.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Join us to engage with a diverse international community, discover new resources and methods, and contribute to the next generation of eye-tracking research!
