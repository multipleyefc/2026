        <!-- Here&rsquo;s where you can put directions to the conference,
        and other information that will help attendees find the location,
        and find the building, and register, and find local places they can stay, etc.
        You can embed a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> iframe
        with directions to the conference like a did below.
        It can also be helpful to include maps of the campus itself,
        or pictures of the building the conference will be held in.
        I&rsquo;ve opted to use a placeholder image of a kitten below. -->
        The conference will take place at <a href="https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en">Faculty of Information Sciences and Computer Engineering</a> at the technical campus of Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje.

    The faculty is easily accessible by public transport (city buses) as well as by taxi.  A taxi ride from Skopje International Airport typically takes around 25–30 minutes and costs €25. Alternatively, I can help organise an airport transfer for €20 through a company we collaborate with (this can be discussed and arranged at a later stage if needed). There is also a shuttle bus from the airport to the city centre, with a ticket price of €3.50. According to the information provided on the shuttle service’s official website, departures are relatively limited. In addition, reaching the venue from the city centre requires a further local bus connection. For these reasons, and taking into consideration that summers in Skopje can be really hot, this option may be less convenient than an organized transfer.
